      <h2>Through blender I was able to create scenes that are cute and cartoonish, yet other worldly. The first one of the room has Pixar like elements to it and is reflective of how I would have wanted my room to look like growing up. The second is a metaphor for me entering into the vast realm that is DMA, so daunting yet so exiciting.</h2>

A main idea of this piece was that; as Americans, we live in a country of excess, and because of that we have become over indulgent and wasteful. The cards stuff their faces with food and wine, much like we stuff our minds with mind numbing content. Why do we do this? Because this is America! (that was a joke)</p> -->
