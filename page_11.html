          <h4> This video is completely AI generated. One main goal for this project was to explore and collborate with AI technology in order to create a comprehensive project.</h4>
          <h4>As artists, we are faced with modern advancements that may or may not threaten our lively hoods as artists. This project is meant to show how a purely AI generated work may not be the most sought after result. I think this project helps prove that AI is not an ultimate replacement for human artists. But rather a tool to help us expedite the work flow, or help make an unobtainable idea, obtainable. This new innovation in technology allows us to think in new ways that we didn't think possible before, especially through traditional mediums. This new found path allows for further artistic expression; one example is being able to work with jerry seinfeld digitally, compared to real life where he would want nothing to do with me.</h4>
