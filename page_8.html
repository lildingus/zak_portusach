    <h2 class="sub-sub-title">I wanted to create a monument that captured an issue that affects everyone on a large scale, and with that in mind I decided that COVID is a strongly relevant topic to work with. I initially thought of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid%27s_Span#:~:text=Cupid's%20Span%20is%20an%20outdoor,and%20piece%20of%20an%20arrow." style="color: white;">Cupid&#39;s Span </a> in San Francisco which captures the city&#39;s culture of love, acceptance, etc, and I wanted to do something that was relevant to California&#39;s culture. California has a long rich and diverse history of native american tribes and I have always been interested in their animal mythology, one being the hummingbird which is a symbol of good luck and healing, which is what we need as a species in order to get through any hardship. I also felt that the image of a bird and flower is a much nicer image for the viewer to look at compared to something morbid like a bacteria cell or a scene of death. The created work consists of a hummingbird mid-flight on one end, and a stem filled with flowers on the other end, coming together to create an archway. The monument would be made entirely out of bronze and the dimensions would be 20ft wide and 40ft tall and the location would be in an outdoorsy area.</h2>
