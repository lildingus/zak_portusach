       <h3> Blockz is a mix of electronic music and 3D visuals that takes the viewer on a wild ride through a constantly changing world. It syncs sound and visuals in a reactive environment, giving you a whole new way to experience electronic music.
        The idea behind Blockz is to show how music and 3D art are kind of alike, both changing and flowing. By combining them, Blockz creates a dynamic experience that's like diving into the heart of electronic music.
        It's not just about cool effects, though. Blockz wants to spark your imagination. You know those weird sounds in electronic music that make you wonder how they're made? Well, Blockz helps you see those sounds, making the music come alive in front of your eyes.
        In simple terms, Blockz is like a mind-bending trip that brings music and visuals together in an exciting new way, making you see electronic music in a whole new light.

            <h3> Creating this project proved to be more challenging than anticipated, there where so many human errors that I had to work through in order to make a coherant piece. One big roadblock I faced was getting the audio frequencies to have a believable reactivity to the assets, as I did not want to to look like the animations were already predetermined. This was a lot of trial and error with matching different audio elements to certains phyiscal elements, making sure everything seemed to react in unison and also to their respected frequencies. Another big issue that I faced was video rendering, I would render it out at a different FPS than originally animated, which left me with countless hours of unusable videos. But once I got everything situated, it was pretty smooth sailing from there, the hardest part ended up being just waiting for this video to render so I can continue on with the other parts. </h3>
