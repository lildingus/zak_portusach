        <p class="sub-sub-title">These playing cards represent the frivelous lifestyle that the public perceives the rich and famous have. A main idea of this piece was that; as Americans, we live in a country of excess, and because of that we have become over indulgent and wasteful. The cards stuff their faces with food and wine, much like we stuff our minds with mind numbing content. Why do we do this? Because this is America! (that was a joke)</p>
